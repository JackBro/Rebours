loader
======

Here is an installation guide for all supported platforms.


Linux (tested on Ubuntu and Debian)
-----------------------------------
First install the following software dependencies:
    - g++
    - git (with its SVN extension)
    - cmake

If you are in hurry, type the following commands in a terminal:

    $ git svn clone https://svn.labri.fr/repos/rebours ./
    $ cd rebours/MAL/loader/
    $ mkdir ./build
    $ cd ./build
    $ cmake ../
    $ make install

If you want to know more about the compilation options:
    $ cmake ../
            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Release*|Debug>
            -DTESTS=<yes|no*>
            -DTESTS_DATA_PATH=<data-path>

Where '<flag0*|flag1|flag2>' is a choice of flags with 'flag0' is the
default choice when the variable is not triggered through the cmake
'-D' option.

And, '<data-path>' is the directory, where tests of the loader project
will look for data files. It is the installation directory of loader's
database of benchmarks. You typically install the database to:
<rebours-install-dir>/data

Note that this directory is necessary only when you set
'-DTESTS=yes'.
    
All built binaries can be found in the directory:

    ./build/../bin/Linux_${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}/lib/MAL
